# Recommender System and Chatbot Implementation


This web app: **Recommender System and Chatbot Implementation**

This repository contains the machine learning implementations for a project conducted for the Social Science Research Council. It aims to enhance the user experience on the DATA2GO.NYC website by identifying correlations between variables that users might otherwise overlook. The project's focus is to provide deeper insights and make the data more digestible for users.

# How it works

- `Recommender System` - Performed Data exploration and Clustering to produce a correlation matrix and utilizing Python and its data science libraries like pandas to give recommendations

- `Chatbot` - Utilized the same correlation data to train a GPT-3.5-Model that analyzes our data for us

- `Webpage Implementation` - React/JS For front end. Python + Replit As backend for our chatbot


## Features

The following functionality is completed:

- [ðŸ—¸] **Sort Results by strongest, weakest, and absolute correlation**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Dynamic Generation of results**
- [ðŸ—¸] **197 available variables to dynamically choose from**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Fully functional recommender system**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Fully functional Correlation Analyst Assistant**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Mobile Friendly/Dynamically Sized**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Similar layout to DATA2GO.NYC website**
- [ðŸ—¸] **Multiple Backends for website itself and chatbot connected for a smooth experience**
