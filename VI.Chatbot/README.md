# K-Means Clustering for Social Science Research Council

This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data into distinct clusters based on their inherent patterns (Variable Category). The goal is to classify similar data points together, which can provide valuable insights into the data's underlying structure and offer actionable recommendations.

## Introduction

We were given the task to improve user experience in the Data2go.nyc website by recommending related variables a user may have missed, by suggesting another variable that is closely related the one selected. K-means is the best approach for this.
